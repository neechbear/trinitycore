Welcome to the configuration menu for this doodad.

I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. You did
exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every
alternative and then you made the hard choice. Your head is not an artifact! I'm
afraid I still don't understand, sir. You enjoyed that. Some days you get the
bear, and some days the bear gets you. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? Fate. It
protects fools, little children, and ships named "Enterprise." Mr. Worf, you do
remember how to fire phasers? I am your worst nightmare! What? We're not at all
alike! A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. The look in your
eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me.
